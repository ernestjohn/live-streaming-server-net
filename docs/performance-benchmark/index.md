# Performance Benchmark

## Method

To conduct the performance benchmarking, all the applications are packaged as Docker images and deployed to [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-instances) with the configuration of `1 vCPU, 2 GiB memory, 0 GPUs`, running on Linux OS.

To facilitate large-scale stream publishing and subscription, the [srs-bench](https://github.com/ossrs/srs-bench/tree/master) benchmarking tool is employed. Besides, all benchmarking tests were performed with the same set of videos at different resolutions and bitrates, including `320P at 200 kbps`, `480P at 500 kbps`, and `720P at 1500 kbps`.

## Code

The following code sets up a live streaming server capable of:

1. Accepting and broadcasting AVC/AAC RTMP streams.
2. Transmuxing all the incoming RTMP stream into an HLS stream with the built-in HLS transmuxer.
3. Serving HLS streams via ASP.NET Coreâ€™s static file middleware.
4. Enabling GOP caching based on the `RTMP_ENABLE_GOP_CACHING` environment variable.
5. Batching media packages within a `350ms` window to optimize performance for large-scale RTMP broadcasting.
6. Providing an admin panel UI.

### Live-Streaming-Server-Net with GOP caching disabled

Generally, if the stream is to be served as HLS, GOP caching, which consumes additional memory, is not necessary. Therefore, the benchmark tests are also conducted with GOP caching disabled.
